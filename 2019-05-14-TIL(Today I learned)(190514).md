- Junction X 해커톤 참가
	- I participated Junction X hackathon as a front-end engineer
	- I implemented the function that helps a client to send a photo of the room to our server
	- After the server getting the photo, it execute python program to detect furniture in the photo and extracts the furniture photos
	- The client then can receive those photos and the user can place those on the room photo.
	- It was the coolest hackathon ever!!!!!
